# Image Classification using CNN on CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Problem Statement
Image classification is a fundamental computer vision task. This project implements
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset
into 10 different categories.

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32×32 color images across 10 classes such as
airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

## Methodology
- Data normalization
- CNN architecture with convolution and pooling layers
- Training using categorical cross-entropy loss
- Performance evaluation on test data

## Model Architecture
- Convolutional Layers
- Max Pooling Layers
- Fully Connected Layers
- Softmax Output Layer

## Results
The CNN achieved reasonable classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset,
demonstrating the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks for image recognition.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a basic yet effective CNN model for image classification
using deep learning techniques.

## Future Work
- Data augmentation
- Deeper CNN architectures
- Transfer learning using pre-trained models
